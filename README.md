# Emergency Room Metrics Dashboard
## In this project I helped visualize emergency room metrics in order to help better understand the ins and outs of the emergency room. Specifically looking at the number of patients visiting, gender of the patients visiting, race of the patients visiting, age of the patients visiting, and the calculated wait times.
